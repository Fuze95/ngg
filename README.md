You are absolutely right\! My apologies. While the content is there, the visual structure could be improved for better readability. Let's refine the formatting to make it clearer and more organized.

Here's a revised version of the README with a stronger focus on visual structure using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks:

# 🔢 Number Guessing Game

Unleash your inner detective and try to guess the secret number! This is a simple yet engaging command-line interface (CLI) game built with Java. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100, and it's your mission to figure out what it is. You'll get clues along the way ("Higher!" or "Lower!") to help you narrow down the possibilities. Can you guess it in the fewest tries and earn a top score?

## ✨ Features

* **Random Number Generation:** A new number between 1 and 100 is randomly generated for each game.
* **Feedback System:** Receive "Higher!" or "Lower!" hints after each guess.
* **Attempt Tracking:** The game counts the number of attempts you take.
* **Score System:** Start with 1000 points; lose 50 points per attempt (minimum score: 0).
* **Input Validation:** Handles non-numeric or out-of-range guesses gracefully.
* **Menu-Driven Interface:** Easily start a new game or exit the program through a simple menu.
* **Organized File Structure:** Source code in `src`, compiled files in `bin`.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher. Get it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or your package manager.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to save the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/NumberGuessingGame.git
cd NumberGuessingGame
````

*(Remember to replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.)*

### 2\. Compile the Code

Ensure you are in the `NumberGuessingGame` directory and run the following command:

```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
```

This will compile the Java files in the `src` directory and place the `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

### 3\. Run the Game

Execute the program from the root directory using this command:

```bash
java -cp bin numberguessinggame.Main
```

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Launch the game** using the run command above. You'll see the main menu:

    ```
    === Number Guessing Game ===
    1. Start New Game
    2. Exit
    Please choose an option:
    ```

2.  **Start a New Game:** Enter `1` and press Enter.

3.  **Make a Guess:** The game will prompt you: `Enter your guess:`. Type a number between 1 and 100 and press Enter.

4.  **Receive Feedback:**

      * `Higher! Try again.` (Your guess was too low)
      * `Lower! Try again.` (Your guess was too high)
      * `Please enter a number between 1 and 100.` (Your guess was out of range)
      * `Please enter a valid number.` (You entered non-numeric input)

5.  **Guess Again:** Continue guessing until you find the secret number.

6.  **Congratulations\!** Once you guess correctly, you'll see a message like:

    ```
    Congratulations! You've guessed the number [The Secret Number] in [Number of Attempts] attempts! Your score: [Your Score]
    ```

7.  **Play Again or Exit:** After the game ends, you'll return to the main menu. Choose `1` to play again or `2` to exit.

## 🏆 Scoring

  * Start with **1000 points**.
  * Lose **50 points** for each attempt (including the correct guess).
  * **Minimum score is 0**.

**Example:** Guessing in 3 attempts results in a score of: `$1000 - (3 \times 50) = 850$`.
